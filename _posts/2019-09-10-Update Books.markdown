Hi，我是Jiri。这是一份会持续更新的书单，内容会涉及各个学科，其中专业书籍居多。我会尽量保持更新的频率，当然，这取决于我的阅读速度与书籍难度:D。

我列出了计划中以及在读的书:
- *SICP*

书的致辞里引用了Alan J. Perlis的话，发人深省，我将它附在这里：
>“I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.”  

- *Networks, Crowds, and Markets*
- *Nonviolent Communication*
